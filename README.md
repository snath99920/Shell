# Shell

This is a simple Shell written in C. Type in make to make the file and hit ./shell to execute the shell

1. Functions like cd, ls, pwd, pinfo have been implemented. 
2. The background process task has also been implemented here.
3. Seperating of commands using ';' works but make sure you use a space between each command and the semicolon. Ex: "pwd ; echo l"

1. cd.c - cd command
2. displayShell.c - displays the shell
3. echo.c - echo command
4. bg.c - background processes and other commands
5. execute.c - connects the codes together
6. history.c - prints history
7. list.c - ls command
8. pinfo.c - pinfo command
9. pwd.c - pwd command
